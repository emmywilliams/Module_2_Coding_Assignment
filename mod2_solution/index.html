          [MUSIC] Okay, you have finished about half the course.
          Congratulations. If you didn't know HTML and CSS before, or didn't
          know it well, take a moment and look back. You are now way more
          skilled than a lot of people who simply mess around with HTML and CSS
          without knowing the foundational concepts. Take a moment and reflect.
